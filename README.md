# CSE-5350-CNN-Research
With the collaboration of 3 students:\
**Cynthia Milan**\
**Manuel Rodriguez**\
**Edgar Gallegos**

We developed an algorithm and used the benchmarks of its accuracy detections to research convolutional neural network (CNN) and gain a deep understanding of human and object detection.
