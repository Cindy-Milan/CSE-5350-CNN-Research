  Computer Neural Networks(CNN) has been a common tool that is defined as image and video recognition. This is commonly used to identify objects, faces and a variety of other items in a frame. Models are used to identify objects through the convolution of connected layers in which each layer contains a single image with a given dimension \cite{Maladkar}. Using the data calculated and linear algebra, a computation of the algorithm is made to complete the processed output image and identification. The team plans to implement a detection algorithm using the following: Raspberry Pi, Tensor Flow Lite implemented with COCO, and Python. The results are not expected to be ideal, but enough to work with a 70 to 80 percent accuracy and still remain within the budget. This will be useful for home security detection that enables the software to not only detect objects but also identify them with at least a 60 percent accuracy.
